A a free python code written by Stefan Haessler, Anthony Guillaume of
[Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquée (LOA), CNRS, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France](https://loa.ensta-paris.fr/research/pco-research-group/)
and Charles Bourassin-Bouchet [Laboratoire Charles Fabry (LCF)), Institut d’Optique, CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, France](https://www.lcf.institutoptique.fr/en/groups/optique-xuv).
Its continued development is mainly led by [Stefan Haessler](https://github.com/mightymightys).

It does ray tracing calculations with a specific focus on ultrashort (femto- and attosecond) laser pulses.

A publication of simulations of the beam transport and focusing of high-numerical-aperture XUV attosecond pulses
is in preparation and will become the reference that we ask you to cite if you have used this code in your work.
