What needs to be done:

- Rewrite rest of examples
- Implement automatic plot dispatching.
- Add tolerancing to ART package
- Add callbacks to ray-tracing and to other functions such as detector optimisation
- Implement polychromatic wavefront extraction
- Implement polarisation assuming paraxiality
- Fix ellipsoidal mirror. For starters, the magic isn't always working (f_img=f_obj example). And the rendering is weird...
- Change run_ART and add it to setup.py so that we can run ART directly as a command
- Add unit test suite with simple setups?
- Add simple grating
- Add report printing to ART package
